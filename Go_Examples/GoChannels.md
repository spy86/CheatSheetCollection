Channels in Golang are like Unix pipes. Create channels using \'make()\'
and the \'chan\' keyword by passing the data type

    my_pipe := make(chan string)

### Reading from Go Channels

To read from a Go channel use the \"\<-\" operator

    value := <-my_pipe

### Writing to Go Channels

To write to a Go channel use \"write()\"

    write(my_pipe, 1000)

### Don\'t write on closed channels
